## New players

If you just began playing RO mobile, there is a lot of different things to explore in the game.

When you start off your adventure, you begin at Cryptura Academy. This map will allow you to jump-start your game, by instantly giving you level 120, and 3rd job level 60 (so you can become 4th job the day after). Also there's a daily growth quest available that will boost your initial character growth. These quests are only available for a single character on your account though, so make sure you use this for the right character.

In RO:Mobile, what most people do is have 1 main character to play on, and then 2 alt characters (extra characters on your account). The alt characters are used for farming extra zeny to support your main character. Some classes are better for farming, so it makes sense to build up an alt with some basic equipment to have an extra income.

The class you play can depend on a lot of factors. Some classes are cheaper to build, some more expensive. Some are better suited for paying players, some better for free players. Some are better at PVP, some are better at killing MVPs. Whatever class you pick, make sure you learn its strengths.

One of the first things recommended is to find an active guild. In a guild, you'll find people and facilities, to help you get stronger. A lot of guilds have different requirements, from level requirements, contribution requirements, Discord use, attendance, etc. Guilds can also have different goals, so find one that matches what you're looking for. A good overview of the active guilds is the recruitment channel on the RO:M Europe discord.

In RO:Mobile there are quite a lot of dungeons that will give you a reward once per week. You can get an overview of these dungeons in the top menu of this website. These dungeons are quite tough, but because some players have been playing for a long time, they can now beat these instances solo. Often guilds or guildmembers will organize carry runs, so make sure you keep an eye on your guild's guildchat or discord so you can finish your weeklies.

RO:Mobile can be a bit intimidating when you first start it, so just ask people for help.
