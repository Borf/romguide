## Aeisr Monument

![aisr]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/aeisr.jpg){: .headerimg}

The [Aeisr Monument](https://www.romcodex.com/item/5501/aeisr-monument) is an item you can unlock through a quest in Prontera. When you start a new account, and go through the academy, it is already unlocked though. After you unlocked the Aeisr monument, you can use it to open a screen where you can distribute [Contribution](https://www.romcodex.com/item/140/contribution) and [Gold Medals](https://www.romcodex.com/item/5261/gold-medal), to unlock more stat bonusses, extra effects for your skills and new skills. The daily growth quest in Cryptura Academy will give you some contribution and gold medals, but you might want to get more, or get some contribution on your alt characters, as the daily growth quest is only available for one of your characters

### How to get Contribution and gold medals

Contribution is kind of like a currency, and can be earned in a lot of different ways. The amount you can earn is capped though, so it will take time to get more contribution, you can't rush it. Contribution can be gotten

- **Through contributing in guild hall**  
  In the back of the first section of guild hall is an NPC where you can get contribution and gold medals in exchange for materials. This NPC will have 10 slots of donation items that you can donate. If you donate enough of an item it wil disappear from the list. Every 2 hours, a new item will come in and push the other items out, if you haven't cleared them. You can donate every item 5 times, where the amount of that item increases every time you donate. This means that clearing an item is quite expensive (but you do get contribution/GM quicker)
- **Guild Quests**  
  Every day, in the guild hall, there will be 3 guild quests. One of the quests you can do alone, for the other one you need 1 guildmember, and for the 3rd one you need 2 guildmembers. These quests will ask you to do various things (take photos, fight monsters, ride rides) and will give you some contribution and sometimes a gold medal
- **Honor proof shop (not recommended)**  
  In Prontera is an NPC that can sell you contribution for honor proof. Honor proof is earned through PVP events (guild wars, competitive PVP, MVP arena). It is recommended to use your honor proof for other uses
- **Events**  
  Some of the events will give you some items that give honor proof when opened
- **Cryptura Academy growth quest**  
  Some of the growth quests will give honor proof

### How to use your Aeisr monument

Once you get some gold medals and contribution, you can use them in the Aeisr monument to get stronger. There are other uses for gold medals and contribution (buying runes), but once you use them in the Aeisr monument, you can not use them for anything else (they become "locked"). It is currently not possible to convert locked contribution or gold medals back to their unlocked version.

To distribute, just open the Aeisr monument, and click the node you want to unlock. Press the activate button, and a route will light up. After this click the blue circle in the bottom to activate it. It is also possible to undo or reset the nodes you selected. To reset, just click the node you don't want anymore, and click reset. All nodes that are 'behind' this node will also get resetted, so for a total reset, click the node in the center.

On the right side of the screen it is also possible to search for specific nodes that boost certain skills, and to change the way the routes to nodes are calculated. Usually the 'Fewest Medals' option works best.

### What nodes do I want to unlock?

This is very class and build dependant, and is discussed on the different class pages. Right now, a lot of players have enough contribution and gold medals to unlock the entire Aeisr Monument, but when starting you won't have enough to unlock it all.
