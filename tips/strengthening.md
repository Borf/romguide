## Strengthening your character

When you start off, your character will not be able to beat the strongest bosses yet, so you'll have to grow your character. Your character's damage will depend on a lot of different mechanics in the game

- Level
- Equipment
- Refining
- Enhancing
- Enchanting
- [Aeisr Monument]({{site.baseurl}}/tips/aeisr)
- Refine Enchanting (anvil)
- Guild Praying Cards
- Guild Blessing
- Adventure Book Deposits
- Runes
- Relics
- Oracle Mirror
- Consumables (cooked food and buffing food)
- Your house level
- Unlocked other classes

Each of these aspects can be improved individually, and will take time and effort to improve.
