# Dailies

{:toc}

Certain things can be done once per day. This page has a list of the daily quests, and the rewards for it

## Mission Board

In most major cities you can find a mission board. The quests on this mission board you can just do instantly, for some nice rewards. To finish the mission board instantly, you can use the Adventure Meatball item, that you can get from your pets. The rewards I'm looking for are Belief Token ![Belief Token](https://roexplorer.com/imgs/item_5034.jpg){: .tinyimg .inline}, and zeny bags, as they can be used to save some zeny. You can do these quests on your main character, and on your alt characters.

## Rift

There are multiple rift events, that you can clear for good and unique items. Every rift has some specific item drops, and some items drop from all rifts. Rifts can be done manually, or automatically, after the rift is cleared once, and if you are 5 levels over the minimum level requirement. To do a rift manually, it is usually wise to party up with some people as most rifts have a monster with reflect, that can easily kill you if you try to solo the rift. To do a rift automatically, open the rift window, either through your assistant or through the NPC in Prontera. Currently, ROM offers the following rifts:

| City | Name | Min Level | Auto Level | Rewards |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| Glastheim | Night of Destruction | 80 | 85 | Flame, Dog Teeth, Broken Blade |
| Aldebaran | Spacetime Nightmare | 90 | 95 | Super Boost, Memory Gem, Glitter Shell |
| Gingerbread City | Horror City | 100 | 100 | Christmas Eggyra, Christmas Socks, Christmas Garland |
| Niflheim | Hamelin | 105 | 105 | Coloful Socks, Wraith Dust, Hypnotic Log |
| Yuno | Firelands | 100 | 100 | Sky Stone, Lava Gem, Harpy's Feather |
| Lighthalzen | Secret Laboratory | 110 | 110 | Dark Magic Stone, Corrupted Pendant, Moldy Gold Coins |
| Rachel | Hell Journey |130 | 130 | Bone Teeth, Remains, Bloody Prayer |

## Guild Donations

In guild hall, just up the stairs, is the guild donation NPC. Here you can donate items to the guild, and in return you get contribution or gold medals, needed for character growth. These items are MVP crafting items for gold medals, and normal item drops or simple items for contribution. Every few hours, some items get added to your donation queue. Your donation queue can only hold 10 donation items, so if a new item gets added, the bottom item disappears and can not be donated anymore. The items that appear in your donation list are dependant on your base level. The higher your level, the more advanced (and usually expensive) the items are you need to donate, so it is wise to start donating early to build your character. It is not needed to buy out everything. Every item can be donated 5 times, where each time will cost more of the item. For gold medals, donation amounts are 1 for 1GM, 3 for 2GM, 6 for 3GM, 10 for 4GM and 15 for 5GM.

## Guild Quests

If you are in a guild (which you should be), there will be 3 quests every day that you can do in guild hall. These quests will give you a chest that gives contribution and a chance for a gold medal. As it is not possible to just buy contribution or gold medals at will, it's wise to do these guild quests for some free growth. Every day you will get 3 quests, that are supposed to be a quest you can do alone, a quest you need 1 guildmate for, and a quest you need 2 guildmates for. There are however some tricks

- If the quest says to make a photo with 1 guildmate, you can just do it alone (you are in your guild)
- If the quest says to ride the payon kite or the whale, you do not actually have to finish the ride. You do have to be on the same channel as the others in your party to do the ride, but once everybody clicks accept, the person starting the ride can just cancel and the quest will still complete
- If the quest requires you to make a photo with 2 guildmates, you have to make 2 photos

## Greedy Shop

In Toy Factory 1F is an NPC called the **Greedy Shop**. This NPC spawns randomly on the map, and can be summoned by killing the gift boxes in the bottomleft corner of the map. After killing these gift boxes, the greedy shop spawns randomly on the map, and will sell certain toy factory mob drops, and has a chance to sell MVP material drops at a low price. Buying items at this shop costs **TODO** in addition to zeny, but the prices are usually quite good.

## Lucky Shop

Most cities have an NPC called the Lucky Shop. In this shop you can buy items for Mora Coins

## Assistant (daily quests)

In prontera castle you can hire an assistant once you reach level **TODO**. By doing daily quests for this assistant, you can get Assistant's Medal of Honor, Mora Coins and Kafra Log Experience.

- Assistant's Medal of Honor
  This item can be traded in for numerous good items, including gacha tickets, crafting materials, XP potions and chains. You can not get over 1800 medals per week, so make sure you reach this cap every week by doing the daily kafra quests
- Mora Coins
  Used for enchanting your equipment. This is one of the few (free) ways of getting Mora Coins, so make sure you do these quests daily
- Kafra Log Experience
  The last episode added the Kafra Log Adventure. By doing your daily assistant quests, you get Kafra Log Experience, to get more levels in your kafra log.
