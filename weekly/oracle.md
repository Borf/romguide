Time to clear: about 10 - 15 minutes

## What is Oracle Dungeon?

Oracle Dungeon is a special arena battle with **TODO** rounds, where every round 3 special 'cards' are drawn. These cards can summon monsters or have special effects on the battle. Every **TODO** rounds will have an MVP summoned, with a total of 3 MVPs. Beat all the monsters and win items. You can only do this once per account per week, so doing it on alts is not useful. This is a team effort, most of the time these runs are not carry-runs, and you will have to learn about the cards, effects and challenges of oracle
