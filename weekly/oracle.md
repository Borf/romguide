## What is Oracle Dungeon?

Oracle Dungeon is a special arena battle with **TODO** rounds, where every round 3 special 'cards' are drawn. These cards can summon monsters or have special effects on the battle. Every **TODO** rounds will have an MVP summoned, with a total of 3 MVPs. When all the cards are done, but there's still monsters alive, a poison will start from the outside of the arena, so you'll have a smaller area to walk. You can only get rewards once per account per week, so doing it on alts is not useful. It is possible to use [Fortune Coins]({{site.base_url}}/fortune-coins) to get extra rewards.

On the right of the map sometimes some cards will spawn that can give you a small buff in for instance attackspeed, movementspeed, magic damage.

This is a team effort, most of the time these runs are not carry-runs, and you will have to learn about the cards, effects and challenges of oracle. You'll usually need a team to clear this dungeon with a tank, a support and DPS classes, as the bosses can have quite some HP

Some of the bosses and stronger monsters can take a bit of time to kill. It's wise not to lure any other mobs while killing the bosses. For a boss round, everybody but the tank move to the right side on the minimap (3 'o clock). The tank lures the boss to the right, and by staying on the right side, the newly spawned monsters won't notice you, and you can fully focus yourself on the boss. Beware though as some monsters can multiply themselves, resulting in a huge amount of monsters if you wait too long.

## Entrance

You can find 3 NPCs in prontera. One to enter oracle, one to view the cards of this week, and one who just wants to have a chat

## Difficulties

There are 4 difficulties, being

- Easy
- Normal
- Hard
- Nightmare

If you clear a difficulty, you will automatically get the rewards for all the easier difficulties (so if you do nightmare, you get the rewards for easy, normal, hard and nightmare)

## Rewards

When finishing oracle, you can get the following rewards. You do not get rewards for clearing half of oracle

## Dangerous Cards

| Card | Name | Difficulty | Thread | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| ![fire-ox]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/oracle/s/fire-ox.png) | Fire Ox | Nightmare | ![star]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/star.png)![star]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/star.png)![star]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/star.png)![star]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/star.png)![star]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/star.png) | The fire ox card spawns a few special ox monsters. If you have effects turned off they will look like chonchons. These monsters can be quite lethal, as they stun and cause damage. There's 2 ways of handling these monsters. <br> - Play Dead<br/>You can act dead on the right side of the map. The oxes won't touch you and won't do a thing. Other monsters however, will see through your acting, and will still attack you, so make sure you stay out of their range<br/> - Run around<br/>Nowadays, a lot of classes have a high movement speed, and with a mount, the movement speed is enough to outrun them. Keep running in circles, and make sure you don't get hitlocked |
| ![Meteor]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/oracle/s/Meteor.png) | Meteor | Difficulty | ![star]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/star.png)![star]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/star.png)![star]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/star.png)![star]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/star.png)![star]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/star.png) | During the round, meteors will fall from the sky. Meteors will fall a number of times, and there will be a red circle on the floor for a few seconds before the meteors hit. Just move out of the circles and you should be fine. These meteors will one-hit kill anyone who gets hit, even tanks. Make sure you get out of the way, or your saint will sigh. Eat anti-death food for these |
| ![sand storm]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/oracle/s/Sandstorm.png) | Sand Storm  | Hard<br/>Nightmare | ![star]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/star.png)![star]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/star.png)![star]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/star.png)![star]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/star.png)![starempty]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/starempty.png) | A sand storm will cover the map, making casting times very long, and causing attacks to miss. Recommended is to take off your auto skills, and try to kill the monsters with skills without casting time, or attacking manually. If you get stuck casting, equip your mount to stop casting |
| ![seed-of-doom]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/oracle/s/Seed-of-doom.png) | Seed of Doom | Nightmare | ![star]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/star.png)![star]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/star.png)![star]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/star.png)![star]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/star.png)![starempty]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/starempty.png)| The seed of doom will cause a damage over time effect. The bad part about this effect is that it's transmittable to other players. If another player with this effect comes near, you'll get this effect again. If unnoticed and without keeping distance, this effect can stay for a long time, so make sure to keep distance |
| ![Sea-of-fire]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/oracle/s/Sea-of-fire.png) | Sea of Fire | Difficulty | ![star]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/star.png)![star]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/star.png)![star]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/star.png)![star]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/star.png)![starempty]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/starempty.png)| A lot of small fires will appear on the map. Standing in them will give you a bit of damage over time. Can be outhealed by saints, but better just not stand in them or your saint or support will get upset |
| ![Ice-River]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/oracle/s/Ice-River.png) | Ice River | Difficulty | ![star]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/star.png)![star]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/star.png)![star]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/star.png)![star]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/starempty.png)![starempty]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/starempty.png)| The center of the stage becomes ice! Equip a [Marc Card](https://www.romcodex.com/item/20028/marc-card) to prevent being frozen, or move outside of the center. |
| ![Swirl-Wind]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/oracle/s/Swirl-Wind.png) | Whirlwind | Difficulty | ![star]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/star.png)![star]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/star.png)![star]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/star.png)![star]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/starempty.png)![starempty]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/starempty.png)| Spawns a number of hurricanes on the map (like the ones in underwater temple), that cause damage and blind your screen. They'll chase players, so just keep running and healing |
| ![Tranquilizer]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/oracle/s/Tranquilizer.png) | Tranquilizer | Difficulty | ![star]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/star.png)![star]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/star.png)![star]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/star.png)![star]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/starempty.png)![starempty]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/starempty.png)| Stuns |

Make sure your HP is full and it shouldn't cause too much problems. If this is combined with sandstorm (saint can't heal you), make sure to eat some [Honey](https://www.romcodex.com/item/12117/honey) |
| ![Magnet]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/oracle/s/Magnet.png) | Magnet | Difficulty | ![star]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/star.png)![star]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/star.png)![star]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/starempty.png)![star]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/starempty.png)![starempty]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/starempty.png)| Makes you unable to move (but still able to attack). Get in position before this round starts |

## Monsters & MVPs

| Name | Difficulty | Thread | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Loli Ruri](https://www.romcodex.com/monster/20028/loli-ruri) | Nightmare | ![star]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/star.png)![star]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/star.png)![star]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/star.png)![star]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/star.png)![star]({{site.base_url}}/assets/images/star.png) | This monster will cause mayhem. It has a skill that causes everybody to move around and take damage and get stunned. Loli Ruri will cast a skill that shows a circle around all players, and everything outside of these circles will be affected. To kill the loli ruri, make sure everybody is stacked, so the circles overlap. The easiest way to align to eachother, is to make sure the HP bars align. Then when you're all stacked, open a chat box so you won't get moved around. When you open a chatbox, your auto-attack will be disabled, so you will have to re-enable it. Communication and coordinated movement are key on taking down the loli ruri. |

## Bad combinations

Before you start your attempt, you can talk to the NPC in the arena, and he will show you the order of cards. Every round will have 3 cards, so you'll have to count them in order to see which cards come together.

- Sandstorm and loli ruri
- Fire Ox and loli ruri
- Seed of doom and loli ruri
- Meteor and loli ruri
