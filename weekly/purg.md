# Purgatory

> Time to clear: about 5 minutes with a full party  
> Minimum Level: **TODO**  
> Rewards: Mythril, MVP drops

Every week you can do the purgatory "dungeon". This dungeon consists of 1 floor, with 4 NPCs that can summon an RMVP, a dark version of the normal MVP. There are 4 NPCs to summon these RMVPs, and the RMVP summoned at the top of the map is stronger than the other RMVPS. These RMVPs can drop different, valuable blueprints from the normal MVPs, so make use of this dungeon to kill them.

This means that if you summon a RMVP and you fail to kill it (your party dies), you will not be able to resummon that RMVP, and you will only have the other RMVPs left to summon. This means it is best to have a strong party, with at least 1 AB with full support, 1 magic DPS to kill any maya that might get summoned, a tank to keep the DPS alive, and some other DPS players to fill the party. The RMVPs can do some special attacks, but the one to look out for is maya, as it will heal if you attack it with anything that is not magic damage.

You can enter the Purgatory dungeon in Niflheim by talking to the NPC
