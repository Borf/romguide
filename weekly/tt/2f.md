## General Mechanics

The tesseract is a non-moving MVP that stays at the center of the map. The main theme of this floor is **lasers**. When you arrive on this floor, there will be a couple of smaller monsters spawned. When they are killed, the real challenge starts. This MVP has 5 phases. The phases start when the tesseract's HP drops below a certain percentage

- 80% - 100% - Phase 1
- 60% - 79% - Phase 2
- 40% - 59% - Phase 3
- 20% - 39% - Phase 4
- 1% - 19% - Phase 5

Out of these phases, only phase 5 is really different. The first 4 phases are all very similar, but get a bit more difficult because the MVP will do more different attacks. The attacks the MVP does, depend on the difficulty and phase of the boss, so this guide will go by attack

### Arcane Bomb (Circle Bomb)

One of the more basic attacks the MVP does. It will summon a number of circles on the floor, that explode after a few seconds. Make sure you get off these circles before they explode. These circles will appear on any difficulty, and in any phase (1,2,3,4,5)

### Ceiling Laser

{: .float-right}

Once in a while, a laser will come from the sky and start chasing a random player. This player will have a flame icon over their head, and is quite obvious to see. You can see it on other players, if you have character display enabled. If you have the laser on you, you have an important task. Some people will be caged (again, you can only see this if you have character display enabled), and to free them you have to run the laser over their cage. Also, sometimes, two people will be linked together by a laser. This link can be broken by having the laser that comes from the sky pass through this link. This can be a bit tedious to break, as it sometimes does not register, but keep trying to break this laser link. The ceiling laser will appear in phases 1,2,3 and 4

This laser also deals some damage to players, if they are hit. On novice and brave, this damage is not too bad, but on legend difficulty, it is around 25% of the HP of a DPS. This means that on legend difficulty, if you have the laser on you, do **not** let the laser cross your party if they are stacked, or it can potentially wipe them. Also make sure you keep moving (can be a small circle), to make sure you don't die yourself.

### Cage

Sometimes, the laser will put a cage on a random person. This cage will prevent you from moving around. On novice and brave this can be a nuisance, on legend this is lethal, as you cannot dodge the circle attacks while being caged. Call out that you're caged, or have the shotcaller call out the caged people, and let the person with the laser on them break them free as soon as possible. While caged, you can still attack the MVP, so make sure you always stay in range so you can continue attacking.. The cages appear in phase 1,2,3 and 4, in brave and legend difficulty

### Watcher's Chains (Laser Link Connection)

Once in a while, a laser link between 2 players will appear. This link can only be broken by the ceiling laser. The laser link has 2 effects, it damages both players and it slows down both players. The damage is dependant on the distance between the two players, the time the link exists and the amount of links, so try to stay together as much as you can, and break the links if possible.

On novice and brave, the damage done is managable, on legend it is not. So try to coordinate and don't go far apart, before the links start. Links can appear in all difficulties, on phase 1,2,3 and 4. In legend difficulty they can also appear on the 5th phase.

### Laser Wall

In phase 2,3,4 on brave and legend difficulty, a wall of lasers can appear that goes from one side of the screen to the other side, covering half of the map. These lasers instantly kill anyone that touches them, so it is important to avoid them. Unfortunately, currently they are not always visible on the screen, or can appear very late. To see the lasers, keep the minimap opened. The lasers will show as a little red dot, going from one side of the screen to the other side. Make sure to be on the other side

### Pewpew

Sometimes the MVP will just do an attack on players. Tanks should taunt the MVP to prevent it from sniping out the DPS

### Summon ads

Once in a while, the MVP will spawn monsters. Make sure you kill these monsters by having protect party on. They can do some damage, but in phase 1 through 4 they don't really pose a threat.

### Gravitational Bodies

In the later phases (3rd, 4th and 5th phase), gravitational bodies will spawn around the map. These gravitational bodies are small enemies that have a big circle around them. This circle grows over time if they stay alive. THe gravitational body will do two attacks. One of the attacks pulls players in the circle towards the gravitational body, and the other attack damages the players nearby. If a gravitational body appears, recommended to stop attacking the MVP and kill the gravitational body as soon as possible

### Phase 5

In the last phase, at 19% HP, the gameplay actually changes, and your team has to collect 5 keys to finish off the tesseract MVP. The keys spawn in blue orbs around the map, and have to be collected and brought to the siren NPC in front of the tesseract. Attacking the tesseract in this does not do any damage, but ads and gravitational bodies will spawn in this phase, so try to kill these if possible. Gravitational bodies can stack up quite fast in this phase. Make sure you spread out the team, so you can collect the keys quickly.

In legend difficulty however, you can get a laser link between players, so it can be very dangerous to split up. It can be wise to let the DPS die on purpose here, so you'll be sure the tanks survive (they have the highest chance of surviving this last phases). Also, after collecting all 5 keys, you do will have to survive for a bit longer, so don't let your guard down after collecting 5 keys.

## Difficulties

### Novice

On novice, the main dangers will be the link between players and the circle explosions. This is a good floor to practice dodging and breaking the laser lines. Just keep damaging, dodging and breaking the lines, and you should be fine.

### Brave

On brave, the boss will have more HP, and will also add the cage attack to cage people, and a laser sweep. Make sure you keep an eye out for the laser sweep, if you can't see it, make sure the shotcaller keeps an eye on the minimap and calls out. Dodge the circles, break the links, keep an eye on the cages and break those, and you should be fine

### Legend

On Legend difficulty, the 2nd floor can be one of the more frustrating floors. At 100%, 59% and 19% HP, the tesseract will cast an explosion. This explosion targets random people, taking them down, usually in one hit. This will cause chaos. Also, people will get linked up right away. The damage of the links is very high, so if you are far away from each other, you can get killed instantly as well. Also, the ceiling laser does a lot of damage, so if that runs through the group, you'll see a lot of dead players.

When starting the instance, everybody gathers in front of the tesseract, in a kind of line so you are close together but not too close. The shotcaller calls to initiate, the tanks will walk forward to the tesseract and all players should follow along. Some people will die when the instance starts due to the explosion, and other people will get linked. Make sure you get close to the person you are linked with, or you will probably die. The tank should taunt the MVP, and DPS should try to put some damage on the MVP to burst it down as soon as possible

After a few people die, usually there will be a bit less chaos and less lines between people. Make sure you stay alive, and don't stray too far from each other. After the circle explosions, get close together again, and try to dodge in the same direction. It is recommended to stay together on one side of the tesseract (the bottom).

At the moment there is a bug, where people can instantly die if they get resurrected before the MVP is down to 59% HP. It is recommended to try and burst the MVP to 59% before resurrecting people.

In the later phases, gravitational bodies will spawn. Make sure you kill them as soon as possible, as they will grow and more will spawn.

In the last phase, only few people will remain. Make sure you collect the keys quick and swiftly, as gravitational bodies and ads will keep spawning. Usually it is the tank who survives here, make sure you call the positions of the keys so they can be collected quickly.

## Tips

- (Legend) Using movement speed food and a mount, it is possible to run away from the circle explosions, even if you're slowed by the laser between people
- (Legend) Stick together, but not too close together

## Roles

### DPS

Make sure you dodge all the lethal lasers on this floor. If you get targeted by the ceilling laser, try to run in a small circle to keep the laser in a small area, and not damage other players. Try to have about 200k hp to at least survive a single explosion

### AB

Keep your ressurection skill off auto, and start ressing at 59%. Keep healing to make sure people who get hit don't immediately die

### Tank

In the first phases, stay close to the MVP and keep taunting

### Shotcaller
