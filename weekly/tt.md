# Thanatos Tower

Thanatos Tower is a boss run for a party of 12 people. This dungeon requires teamwork, and it is recommended to organize a balanced party. A basic party setup consists of

- 2x Archbishop
- 2x Royal Guard
- 1x Warlock for 'phreeoni duty' on 4F
- 7x DPS

for the Legend difficulty, one of the DPS will have to be a Mechanic, with the Neutral Barrier skill, and someone will have to be equipped for 'chain duty'. Having a warlock is very recommended
